# Day 3 GitHub-Exercise
Welcome to the final exercise of Day 3. 

## Part 1) - Getting the Code
  -  Create a Fork of the Code (This will create a version of the code in its current state on your GitHub Account)
  -  Create a Local Repository and connect it to your forked remote repository
  -  Make a pull request to Pull the Code from the remote repository to your local repository
## Part 2) - Changing the Code
Calculator.py currently takes two numbers and adds them together, the code is very basic. We would like to create a class based approach.
The class should store three things; the two numbers the user inputted, and the output of an operation.

The class should have the following methods:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Modular Arithmetic

## Part 3) Branches and Uploading
Updating the Code in Calculator.py should not be done on the main branch. You should create a seperate branch feature-calculator. Once you're happy upload feature-calculator to GitHub. This way someone else (theoretically) can give you the go ahead to say your code is working. Once happy, commit the changes to the main branch. Don't delete the feature-calculator branch, because you could come back to update this code again later on with more functionality, and thus need this branch again.
